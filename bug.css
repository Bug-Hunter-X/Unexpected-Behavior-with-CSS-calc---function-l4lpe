The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes lead to unexpected results if you're not careful with operator precedence and unit handling. For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px);` works as expected, but mixing percentages and other units might lead to issues if not written carefully.  Another common issue is forgetting to wrap values in parentheses when using multiple operations.  Incorrectly nested `calc()` functions can also result in parsing errors.
